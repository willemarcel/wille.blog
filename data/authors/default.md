Hi, I'm Wille!

I am a software engineer focused on rich web map applications. I am a long-time
supporter of OpenStreetMap and open Geographic Information Systems, with a special
expertise on designing APIs, satellite imagery and web map applications. Currently,
I'm part of the [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) team.

In 2015, I created the OSMCha application, a very important tool for quality control
and monitoring of changes of OpenStreetMap. Between 2017 and mid 2021, I maintained
OSMCha, with the support of [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com).

From 2018 to June, 2021, I worked for the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/)
and led the development of the Tasking Manager 4 frontend interface and of the
OpenMapKit-Server redesign.

You can know a bit more about these software in the [Projects](/projects/) page.
